# NOVA

NOVA is a 2D side scrolling pixel art platformer made in Unity. This project was created for my Cross-Platform Development Assessment.

## Purpose 
The main purpose of this project is to get a foot hold in the unity engine as well as exporting to multiple platforms. For some reason I decided to make a pixel art platformer in unity, a infamously annoying task due to the fact that Unity's support is very lacklustre for 2D, without numerous scripts and manual collision detection just to get movement working right the project would look and or feel right.

Related to exporting for multiple platforms this project also has controller support as well as touch controls for mobile.

## TBA
More info will be added here upon further completion of the project.
